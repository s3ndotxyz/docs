Decentralisation thrives on a paradox. It empowers users with data ownership, disrupting traditional control by fostering a permissionless ecosystem. Yet, this very autonomy clashes with regulations and law enforcement's need for user data to combat theft and fraud. Data brokers exploit this tension, profiting from information web3 aims to return to users.

One might assume that traditional identity systems could address this issue. However, existing solutions are far from sufficient. Identity breaches accounted for over 19% (1 million cases) of personal data theft reports in 2023 alone. Even popular solutions like Fractal ID, which experienced a data breach on July 14th, 2024, demonstrate the vulnerability of non-self-sovereign identity systems. To truly protect your identity data, you must have control over it.

Fragmentation is another significant challenge. Identity data is currently scattered across multiple locations, making aggregation a complex and sensitive process. The limitations afore mentioned, coupled with the increasing insecurity of personal identity data, necessitate a more secure and user-centric approach. One that has the user in control. One we aim to develop.
